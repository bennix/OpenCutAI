# Papercraft Diorama Postcard — Preset

A photoreal 1:1 social image: a vintage postcard lying in the foreground with a layered paper-cut world rising out of it, a collectible traveller figure standing inside that world, and the real destination dissolving into bokeh behind.

Ground is the **photograph itself** — the third of the three shipped grounds, and the only preset here with `render_mode: photographic`.

Requires a `[destination]` value. Everything else is derived from it.

free: [title, subtitle, recoveries]

hard_constraints:
  - "The postcard stays tack-sharp; only the real-world background is blurred"
  - "One to three iconic landmarks maximum — never a crowd of attractions"
  - "The paper-cut elements emerge from the postcard surface, physically continuous with it"
  - "Handwritten copy is unique to the destination, never generic"
```

## Photo Policy

```yaml
photo_policy:
  fidelity: none
  reference_image: none
  source_region: full-bleed
```

No photograph is supplied — the model generates one. `ground: full-bleed-photo` is satisfied here by `render_mode: photographic`, which is the second of the two routes the spec allows ([../spec/editorial-spec.schema.md](../spec/editorial-spec.schema.md)).

## Destination Adaptation Rules

| Element | Derived from |
|---------|--------------|
| Traveller's clothing | Local climate and culture |
| Architecture in the paper-cut | Local building vernacular |
| Landmark selection | 1–3 iconic features, no more |
| Colour grade | The destination's own light |
| Handwritten quote | Unique to that place |

Emphasise the secret, dreamlike, storybook register. Avoid generic tourist scenes and crowds.

## Copy Slots

```
Title       [destination], [country]
Body        有些地方不求關注 —— 它們只是留在你心中。
Closing     去往地圖靜止的地方。
```

Keep exact in-image text short; image models are unreliable with long strings. If the model garbles the body line, drop it to the postcard's handwriting layer as illegible script rather than lengthening the prompt.

## Avoids

Crowds and generic tourist landmarks · flat lighting · a blurred postcard · paper-cut elements floating free of the postcard surface · more than three landmarks · invented logos · watermark · mockup device frame

## Compiler anchor

```
Square photoreal image, slightly elevated three-quarter view. A vintage
postcard of [destination] lies in the foreground, tack-sharp, with rounded
corners, visible paper stock, a stamp, a postmark, and handwritten travel
notes. A layered paper-cut world rises out of the postcard surface and is
physically continuous with it: cut-paper terrain, local vernacular
architecture, one to three iconic landmarks, vegetation, coastline. A
stylised collectible traveller figure stands inside that world in local
climate-appropriate dress, expressive pose, realistic proportions, small
narrative props. Behind everything, the real [destination] falls away into
creamy bokeh. Warm natural light, shallow depth of field, realistic shadows,
colour grade drawn from the destination's own light. Handwritten line reads
"[quote]". Avoid crowds, generic tourist landmarks, flat lighting, a blurred
postcard, floating paper elements, watermark, mockup frame.
```

## Provenance

This preset was written from the author's own known-good prompt, kept below unedited so the preset's origin is auditable. It is **reference material, not an alternative path** — the compiler anchor above is what runs. The anchor drops `8K`, `masterpiece`, `premium`, `luxury`, and `杰作`, which [../prompts/compiler.md](../prompts/compiler.md) bans because they do not change pixels, and the [Reviewer](../prompts/reviewer.md) rejects any request that reintroduces them.

## Notes

`texture_tier: FLAT` is not a contradiction of all the paper in this image. The tier governs the **canvas ground**, and this preset's canvas ground is a photograph — `ground: full-bleed-photo` is always FLAT ([../assets/texture.md](../assets/texture.md)). The postcard stock and cut-paper layers are *objects inside the photograph*: subject matter, not canvas texture. No PRINT-tier defect language is permitted, and Wallpaper\* would not qualify for SURFACE in any case (no material dimension in its DNA).
